# Graph Implementors Guide

Graph API provides a set of traits that can be implemented for your graph that provide users with a consistent
API between graph implementations.

For example, in a social network property graph:
- A vertex might represent a person with properties like name, age, and location
- Edges might represent relationships like "Follows", "Likes", or "Created"
- Edge properties could include timestamps or relationship strengths

##

### Basic Example

```rust
fn example() {
    let mut graph = SimpleGraph::new();
    
    // Add vertices
    let person = graph.add_vertex(Vertex::Person {
        name: "Bryn".to_string(),
        age: 45,
        unique_id: Uuid::new_v4(), // Using random UUID is preferred
        username: "bryn".to_string(),
        biography: "Graph systems developer".to_string(),
    });
    
    let project = graph.add_vertex(Vertex::Project { 
        name: "Graph API".to_string() 
    });
    
    // Connect vertices with an edge
    graph.add_edge(person, project, Edge::Created)?;
}
```

### Graph Traversal

The API provides a powerful walker interface for graph traversal, eliminating the need for manual iteration:

```rust
fn traversal_example() -> Result<Vec<Edge>, GraphError> {
    let graph = SimpleGraph::new();
    
    // Traverse the graph starting from vertices named "Bryn"
    let edges = graph.walk()
        .vertices(VertexSelector::by_name("Bryn"))
        .out_edges(None)  // Get all outgoing edges
        .collect::<Result<Vec<_>, _>>()?;
        
    Ok(edges)
}
```

### Derive Macros

The API includes derive macros that:
- Generate efficient graph traversal implementations
- Define static indexing rules
- Implement common trait patterns for vertices and edges

## Implementation Guide

To implement a new graph type:

1. [Create your Graph implementation](./graphs.md)
    - Implement core traits like `Graph`, `VertexContainer`, and `EdgeContainer`
    - Define vertex and edge storage

2. [Use the Graph API test suite](./testing.md)
    - Run comprehensive test cases
    - Verify correctness of implementation
    - Check performance benchmarks

3. [Enable optional features](./features.md)
    - Add support for serialization
    - Implement custom indexing
    - Enable concurrent access (if needed)

4. [Implement indexing](./indexes.md)
    - Add vertex and edge indexes
    - Define custom index types
    - Optimize query performance

### Reference Implementation

For a complete example, refer to the `SimpleGraph` implementation in the source code, which demonstrates best practices and common patterns.

## Error Handling

Graph operations should return `Result` types to handle common failure cases:
- Invalid vertex/edge IDs
- Duplicate elements
- Constraint violations
- Index corruption

## Performance Considerations

When implementing a graph, consider:
- Memory efficiency of vertex/edge storage
- Index maintenance overhead
- Traversal performance
- Concurrency requirements
