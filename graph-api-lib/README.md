# Graph-API-Lib

**graph-api-lib** is a general-purpose library designed to work with various graph implementations, providing a
standardized set of APIs for graph **mutation** and **traversal**. Its purpose is to abstract the complexity of working
with graph data structures and to unify interactions across different graph implementations, enabling developers to
write graph-related logic independent of the underlying data representation.

With **graph-api-lib**, you can perform common graph operations — such as adding/removing nodes and edges, traversing
graphs, or analyzing their structure — without needing to be tied to a specific graph framework or library.

## Key Features

1. **Unified Graph API**: A consistent set of methods for graph manipulation and traversal.
2. **Flexibility**: Supports integration with different graph backends or custom implementations.
3. **Ease of Use**: Abstracts low-level graph operations, making graph-related code cleaner and easier to maintain.
4. **Traversal Capabilities**: Includes built-in support for depth-first search (DFS).

## Future Development

1. Algorithm support: Shortest path etc.
2. Cycle detection: Prevent traversals from visiting the same element twice.
3. API refinement: This is version 0.1 after all!
